# FC_Linux_Initial_Setup

This is a script for automating the package installation after a fresh install of Fedora Workstation, starting with FC 25. All the packages installed belong to the default repositories, RPM Fusion free and nonfree, and google-chrome.

Additionally, the startup.m file is a MATLAB initialization file to be saved in /home/ and contains definitions of layouts for figures and text.
