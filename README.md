# FC_Linux_Initial_Setup

This is a script for automating the package installation after a fresh install of Fedora Workstation. Support begins with FC 25/26/27. All the packages installed belong to the default repositories, RPM Fusion free and nonfree, and google-chrome.

Additionally, the startup.m file is a MATLAB initialization file to be saved in /home/ and contains definitions of layouts for figures and text.

Please note that some steps require root permissions (such as adding the google-chrome repos to yum.repos file), so you run this script under your strict responsibility.
